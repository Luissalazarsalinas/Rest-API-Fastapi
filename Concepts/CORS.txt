CORS - api securiy

- Cross Origin Resources Sharing (CORS) allows you to make requests form a web browser
on one domain to server on a different domain

-corsd refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that 
communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.

- By defualt our API will only web browsers running on the same 
domain as our server to make requests to it.

- middleware is a funtion that runs before the requests
